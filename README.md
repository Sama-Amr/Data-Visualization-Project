# Data-Visualization-Project
A visualization project intending to summarize the main attributes of the dataset, identify relationships between attributes, and explore the possible occurrence of trends for countries that have similar economic states.

# Description of the Data
This dataset contains 7 attributes, and they include GDP total, population, income per
person, total broadband subscribers, total cell phones, internet users, and total personal
computers.
- GDP total, yearly growth: Based on Gapminder's GDP per capita, PPP
- Population: Total population per year for each country.
- Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted): Gross domestic product per
person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2017 prices,
PPP based on 2017 ICP).
- Broadband subscribers (total): Fixed broadband subscriptions refer to fixed subscriptions to
high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to,
or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fiber-to-the-home/building, other
fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband, and terrestrial fixed wireless
broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes
subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via
mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless
technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations
- Cell phones (total): Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions are subscriptions to a public mobile
telephone service that provide access to the PSTN using cellular technology. The indicator
includes (and is split into) the number of postpaid subscriptions, and the number of active
prepaid accounts (i.e. that have been used during the last three months). The indicator applies to
all mobile cellular subscriptions that offer voice communications. It excludes subscriptions via
data cards or USB modems, subscriptions to public mobile data services, private trunked mobile
radio, telepoint, radio paging, and telemetry services.
- Individuals using the Internet (% of population): The percentage of the population that is
using the internet.
- Personal computers (total): Total number of computers per person.
